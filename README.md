# The Year's End Calendar!

This is a flutter Advent Calendar app for people who don't celebrate christmas.
It is adjustable for "normal" usage of 24 days. 

The app has been tested on Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.
Please report back any Errors or Bugs you encounter.

## The App:

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="/assets/screenshots/Screen-Home.png" alt="Homescreen" width="30%" height="30%">
    </br>
    <p>The Home Screen of the App as shown when the Calendar is active </p>
    </br>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="/assets/screenshots/Screen-Cal.png" alt="Calendar View" width="30%" height="30%">
    </br>
    <p>The Calendar View of the App with the already "opened" days being a darker colour and the days that are not yet available being grey.</p>
    </br>
  </div>

## How to Use:

Write the Text of the Coupons for each day into the matching key in the JSON file.
The Coupon will appear one the user taps the desired day!
